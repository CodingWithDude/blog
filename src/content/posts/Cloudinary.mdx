## Why I Started Using Cloudinary

As an aspiring self taught developer I am always excited to discover tools that make building great projects a bit easier. As I began learning Next.js I learned quickly that you needed to setup the domains that your images would be coming from.

The first thing that I loved was I now only had one domain and one place to store my images and videos.

```js title="next.config.js" {4} showLineNumbers
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  images: { domains: ['res.cloudinary.com'] },
};
```

Cloudinary also allows you to automatically scale down your images right in the url request so the size you need is the size you request.

```js title="GradientBackground.tsx" showLineNumbers /h_500/
// Tailwindcss Background image
<div
  className="h-full transition-all ease-in
    bg-[url('https://res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/h_500/blog/bg_gradient.png')]
    bg-top bg-no-repeat opacity-[0.2] will-change-transform"
></div>

// Image
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/h_500/blog/bg_gradient.png" alt="image" />
```
